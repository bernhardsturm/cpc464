# CPC464 Emulator with Raspberry Pi
If you want to build your own 1984 CPC464 Z80-8Bit-Emulator on a dedicaded machine, then follow this instructions:

## What will I get?
You will end up with e bootable CPC464 (or CPC464+ or CPC6128) machine. Turning your power switch to on, and after a few seconds (yes, it is not as quick as the original machine), you are taken back to the year 1984. 
You can use old original games on disc or tape (tape and disc drive will be emulated, too). You can even plug in an old Joystick, and game like 1984 all over again. Or you can teach your kids (or yourself) good old BASIC.

## Who does it work?
The emulator runs on Raspberry Pi hardware. So all you need is a spare monitor, and a keyboard, and off you go.
